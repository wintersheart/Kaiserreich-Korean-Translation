unionstate.12.d:0 "롱은 미국의 산업이 더욱 확장될 수 있도록 수입품에 막대한 관세를 부과하기로 계획했습니다. 그는 관세가 결국에는 경제에 나쁠 수도 있다는 경고를 받았습니다. "

unionstate.13.a:0 "젠장."
unionstate.14.t:0 "공개 재판"
unionstate.14.d:0 "아메리카 사회주의는 패배했고, 이제 롱은 그들에게 대가를 치르게 할 것입니다. 사회주의자들, 아나키스트들 그리고 CSA를 지지한 자들은 미주연합 정부에 의해 고발되었습니다. 미뉴트 맨은 좌익들을 구속하고 특별 재판을 시작했습니다. 이 재판은 피고인들을 모욕하고 공격하는 공개 재판에 지나지 않았습니다."

unionstate.11.t:0 "인두세"
unionstate.11.d:0 "롱은 남부의 인종적 긴장을 완화하기 위해 인두세 폐지를 원했습니다. 그의 제안은 즉각 당 내의 극단주의자들의 규탄을 맞이했습니다. 펠리 패거리들은 롱이 남부의 신성한 제도를 파괴하려 한다고 비난했습니다. 롱은 인종주의는 결코 신성하지 않으며, 이 사악한 제도를 철폐하기 위해 대중 집회를 열었습니다."

unionstate.17.t:0 "산업 보안법"
unionstate.17.d:0 "산업 보안법은 북부의 노조에 대한 롱의 해답입니다. 이 법으로 노동자에 의한 필수 산업의 혼란은 산업을 무너뜨릴려는 음모로 여겨질 것이며, 징역형이 내려질 것입니다. 대통령이 노조를 효과적으로 꺾을 수 있도록 그 법의 단어 선택은 의도적으로 모호합니다."
unionstate.17.a:0 "법을 통과시켜라"
unionstate.17.b:0 "이건 과하다"
unionstate.18.t:0 "산업 분산법"
unionstate.18.d:0 "롱은 러스트 벨트을 노조와 사회주의자들이 타락시켰다고 보았습니다. 러스트 벨트에 있는 산업은 노동 연맹에 큰 도움을 주었으며 롱은 이런 일이 다시는 일어나지 않도록 하고 싶었습니다. 러스트 벨트의 타락을 없애고 노조의 힘을 빼앗기 위해 산업을 러스트 벨트에서 중서부와 남부로 옮기는 계획이 추진될 것입니다."

unionstate.19.a:0 "Excellent"
unionstate.35.t:0 "New flag for the Republic"
unionstate.35.d:0 "While most of the troops of the American Union State are battling both the old regime and the Combined Syndicates under the eagle banner of the America First Party, some units, especially those raised on the deep south, have been flying their own colours. As this situation has come to the attention of president Long, a special committee was raised to determine a single flag for all the forces of the Republic."
unionstate.35.a:0 "Choose the 'Coast Guard' flag"
unionstate.35.b:0 "Adopt the 'Saltire-and-star'"
unionstate.35.c:0 "'The 'Sword-and-torch' flag"
unionstate.35.e:0 "Keep using the current party banner"
unionstate.36.t:0 "The Long Doctrine"
unionstate.36.d:0 "With the American Union State firmly established, defeating the syndicates in Central and South America was necessary to ensure the security of the new state. A strong position would allow for interventionism against the syndicates before they could successfully secure a position in the Western Hemisphere. Some were concerned that the AUS was spreading itself thin and that internal issues should be addressed first."
unionstate.36.a:0 "Syndicalism must be stopped."
unionstate.36.b:0 "America first."
unionstate.38.t:0 "The Syndicate Threat"
unionstate.38.d:0 "With the fall of Berlin serious questions about the American Union's security were raised. Syndicate domination of Europe was not in the American Union's best interest. Debate as to what action the AUS should take was becoming a major issue. Most were in favour of supporting Germany in its war against the syndicates but an isolationist movement was forming to keep America out of a foreign war."
unionstate.38.a:0 "We should remain neutral"
unionstate.38.b:0 "We need to send support!"
unionstate.38.c:0 "War!"
unionstate.38.e:0 "Join the Reichspakt!"
unionstate.39.t:0 "The Issue of New England"
unionstate.39.d:0 "The independence of the state of New England had been a contentious issue for the government of the AUS. The reintegration of the state back into the American Union had been made the highest priority and it was unlikely that the government would be deterred by a possible war with the Entente. The stakes were high for the American Union State."
unionstate.39.a:0 "Demand their return"
unionstate.39.b:0 "We should not risk it"
unionstate.40.t:0 "Canada Responds to the AUS Demands"
unionstate.40.d:0 "The alliance between New England and Canada had been one of opportunity but the demand made by the AUS caused strain. The conservatives led by the King were unwilling to alienate Long over New England but others did not wish to abandon New England after what they had been through."
unionstate.40.a:0 "The King is right. We need the AUS"
unionstate.40.b:0 "We must stand by our friends"
unionstate.41.t:0 "New England Stands Alone"
unionstate.41.d:0 "The Entente has abandoned New England to the hands of the AUS. The people of New England have very little hope of overcoming the AUS and the feeling in the state is that they have very little hope."
unionstate.41.a:0 "We have no choice..."
unionstate.41.b:0 "...but to fight!"
unionstate.42.t:0 "New England Accepts Our Demands"
unionstate.42.d:0 "New England has surrendered to our demands and they have been reintegrated into the American Union."
unionstate.42.a:0 "Excellent"
unionstate.43.t:0 "New England Refuses Our Demands"
unionstate.43.d:0 "New England has refused to accept our demands and it is causing a great deal of dissent in the country. The people do not wish another war but it may be inevitable because of how New England has responded."
unionstate.43.a:0 "Outrageous. We will destroy them."
unionstate.43.b:0 "Another war is intolerable."
unionstate.44.t:0 "Entente supports New England!"
unionstate.44.d:0 "The Entente will support New England against the AUS. But, the people of New England feel they still have very little hope of overcoming the AUS and the feeling in the state is that they should surrender anyway."
unionstate.44.a:0 "We have no choice..."
unionstate.44.b:0 "...but to fight!"
unionstate.45.t:0 "New England Stands Alone"
unionstate.45.d:0 "New England stands alone against the AUS and most of the people in New England are unwilling to fight the AUS. Surrender seems inevitable."
unionstate.45.a:0 "We have no choice..."
unionstate.45.b:0 "...but to fight!"
unionstate.46.t:0 "The Long Doctrine"
unionstate.46.d:0 "The new American Union State has proclaimed a policy aimed at extinguishing Syndicalism throughout the Americas. Such a policy is an obvious threat to Mexico."
unionstate.46.a:0 "A new threat arises"

unionstate.49.d:0 "The new American Union State has proclaimed a policy aimed at extinguishing Syndicalism throughout the Americas. Such a policy is an obvious threat to Bolivia."
unionstate.49.a:0 "A new threat arises"
unionstate.50.t:0 "The Pacific Question"
unionstate.50.d:0 "The American Union state had been victorious in the war and now was forced to deal with the PSA. The Pacific states were rich in resources and the government was unfriendly to the AUS so removing that threat was an option but some less radical elements believed that the AUS had been at war enough and that a further war would put unnecessary strain on the delicate hold the government had."
unionstate.50.a:0 "War will end this!"
unionstate.50.b:0 "We should try and coexist with neighbours."
unionstate.51.t:0 "The Mexican Question"
unionstate.51.d:0 "With territory of the former USA under our firm control, time has come to directly implement the Long doctrine and eradicate syndicalism from America. We should start with our southern neighbour - Mexico. The incompetence of the previous governments allowed Syndicalism to root deeply within Mexican society. The only way how to solve this matter is direct military confrontation..."
unionstate.51.a:0 "War will end this!"
unionstate.51.b:0 "We should try and coexist with neighbours."
unionstate.52.t:0 "미주 연합으로부터의 원조!"
unionstate.52.d:0 "The American Union State, fearing Syndicalist dominance over Europe, decided to support our armed struggle with large amounts of military supplies and volunteers eager to see Syndicalism crushed."
unionstate.52.a:0 "없는 것보다야 낫다!"
unionstate.53.t:0 "Our place in the sun"
unionstate.53.d:0 "The occupation of American overseas territory by foreign powers during the Civil War was an affront to the Union State. The establishment of Canadian authority over the Panamá Canal Zone, however, was a provocation that could not be overlooked. The victorious government now looked to restore those lands seized by their neighbour to the north."

unionstate.57.t:0 "The Case of Guantanamo Bay Naval Base"
unionstate.57.d:0 "The occupation of American overseas territory by foreign powers during the Civil War was an affront to the American Union State. The establishment of Cuban authority over the Guantanamo bay naval base, however, was a provocation that could not be overlooked. The victorious government now looked to restore those lands seized by their neighbour to the south."
unionstate.57.a:0 "Demand return of the naval base"
unionstate.57.b:0 "Our concern is elsewhere"
